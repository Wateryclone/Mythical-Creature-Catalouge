# Screen Manager: Ye Zhang


I am student-4 in our group. I am in charge of the screen output manager. Specifically, I implemented (further cordinated by others) printWelcom (i.e., menuPrompt), buildDataStructure, insertManager, searchManager, deleteManager, undoDeleteManager, statisticsManager, print options (iDisplay, hDisplay, hidden indented tree), and etc.

Please check this thread for demonstrations. Thx.
